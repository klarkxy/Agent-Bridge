# Agent Bridge orchestration

> Coordinator rules; skill and MCP instructions derive from this file. Copy as `AGENTS.md` or install [the skill](skills/agent-bridge/SKILL.md).

The host orchestrator (Codex: `multi-agent-control`) defines TaskNodes; Bridge executes their external leaves.

You coordinate Grok Build, Kimi Code, Antigravity, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Devin CLI, ZCode, and MiniMax Code. Own architecture and acceptance; users talk to you. Coordinator and worker roles always use separate processes.

Provider-native subagents remain available within the assigned leaf. They must not receive, discover, or call Bridge, own Git, or accept results.

## Mode and user preferences

Call `list_agents` first and re-read `coordinator` before every dispatch.

- `mode` — `manual`: dispatch only what the user explicitly asked for; `dispatch_task` needs `user_requested=true`. `auto` (default): your judgment, Step 1. `eager`: prefer dispatching multi-step work; you still accept.
- `instructions` — the user's routing preferences. They override Step 2.
- `runtime_context` / `dispatch_enabled` — top-level host is `coordinator` / `true`. If `dispatch_enabled` is false, this Bridge was inherited inside a worker: do **not** call `dispatch_task`, `set_preferences`, `cancel_task`, or `end_session`. `user_requested=true` does not bypass that. Nested instances use `nested/` and do not share `state.json`.

When the user states a **lasting** preference, persist it with `set_preferences`. Its `instructions` argument replaces the stored text — read the current value first and write the merge. One-off wishes are not preferences.

Workers are reached **only** through Agent Bridge MCP tools (`list_agents`, `dispatch_task`, `wait_task`, `check_task`, `get_result`, `get_transcript`, `cancel_task`, `list_sessions`, `end_session`). If those tools are missing, stop and say so. Do **not** run `kimi`, `grok`, `agy`, `dsh`, `opencode`, `claude`, `claude-agent-acp`, `codex`, `devin`, `zcode-acp-server`, or `mcode` yourself. `git` / `pytest` after a turn is review, not a substitute for dispatch.

## Step 1 — dispatch, or do it yourself?

Dispatch only when delegation saves work.

Do it yourself when: after 1–2 files you already know the exact edit; the job is reading a little code and answering; or writing the dispatch message would cost more than the change.

Dispatch when: the change spans several files or needs unexplored work; tests or a build loop must be iterated; breadth research; or not dispatching would eat many mechanical turns.

If every worker is `available: false`, do the work yourself. If the Bridge tools are missing, report that — do not do the worker's job in-process.

Each `list_agents` row carries `quota` (`status` ok / exhausted / unknown, `windows[].remaining_percent` + `resets_at`, `balance`) — information, not a routing rule. `exhausted` means the turn will likely fail: prefer another worker or say when it resets. `unknown` means unreadable (unsupported CLI, API-key login, timeout, custom endpoint), not empty; cache expires at window reset. DSH balance is unsupported.

Claude `status`: shared `5h`/`weekly` only. Even when `ok`, check the model's `weekly:opus`/`weekly:sonnet` before dispatch: 0% exhausted, missing/null unknown — report reset time or a permitted alternative. Model-only data leaves shared status unknown.

## Step 2 — which worker

User `instructions` override this.

- **Antigravity (Gemini):** research, surveys, breadth-heavy or lightweight tasks.
- **Grok Build:** default implementer — features, refactors, tests, multi-file code.
- **Kimi Code:** second implementer — Grok busy or wrong, independent take, or large single-context jobs (`kimi-code/k3-256k`).
- **OpenCode:** optional third implementer — user asked, a connected provider/model, or Grok and Kimi are busy.
- **Claude Code:** optional implementer — user asked, or Grok and Kimi are busy. Worker binary is `claude-agent-acp`, not product `claude`.
- **Codex CLI:** optional implementer — user asked, or others are busy. Desktop-bundled `codex exec`, not the Desktop GUI. Same product as this coordinator is a different process.
- **Devin CLI:** optional implementer — user asked, or others are busy. `devin acp`, not Devin Desktop.
- **ZCode:** optional implementer — user asked, or others are busy. Worker is `zcode-acp-server`, not the ZCode app.
- **MiniMax Code:** optional implementer — user asked, or others are busy. `mcode acp`.
- **DeepSeek Harness:** only if others are unavailable or the user asked.

In `auto`/`eager`, tell the user after the fact. In `manual`, their explicit request is the permission.

## How to dispatch

1. `list_agents`. Read `coordinator.mode` / `instructions` / `dispatch_enabled` and `env.proxy` / `env.warnings`. A null proxy on a direct network is normal; if a worker fails with connect errors on a proxied machine, fix `[env.proxy]` instead of retrying.
2. `dispatch_task`: absolute coordinator-owned `cwd`, including coordinator-created worktrees. Bridge never creates, switches, commits, or merges them. Optional `task_key`, `task_mode`, `write_paths`, `workspace_mode` (`shared`/`patch_only`/`worktree`), and `base_revision` are attribution, not a sandbox. Self-contained `message`; set `model`/`effort` only when needed.
   - Antigravity: `agy models` slugs; default `gemini-3.7-flash`.
   - Grok: `grok models` slug + `off|low|medium|high|max` (`off`→`none`, `max`→`xhigh`). `/new` starts on the campaign default; Bridge `session/setModel` afterwards. Trust `get_result.observed_model`, never the "You are Grok 4.6" banner.
   - Kimi: advertised slugs + the same five tokens mapped onto that model's levels. Unknown slug fails; unmappable effort is a warning.
   - OpenCode: advertised `provider/model` + the same five tokens. Unknown slug fails; missing/unmappable effort is a warning. `observed_*` are last values Bridge set. Model switch re-applies effort. Revive via `session/resume`.
   - Claude Code: advertised slugs (`sonnet` / `opus` / `haiku` / full ids) + the same five tokens (`off`→`default`, `max`→`xhigh`). Unknown slug fails; missing/unmappable effort is a warning. Mode forced to `bypassPermissions`. Revive via `session/resume`.
   - Cursor: exact IDs from `cursor-agent --list-models`. Bridge pins the launch and maps the ID onto advertised model/parameter options. The same `session_id` can switch models. `observed_*` are confirmed values, not a live sampler.
   - DSH: `provider/model` + `off|low|high|max`; unknown model fails, unmappable effort warns. Native `--profile acp` switches live via `session/set_config_option`; the demo respawns.
   - Codex CLI: advertised slugs + `off|low|medium|high|max` (`off`→`none`). Default `--approve-for-me`; prompt on stdin. Revive via `exec resume`. Startup failures before JSONL are returned in `get_result.error`.
   - Devin CLI: advertised ids (`devin models list`; level is in the id, e.g. `swe-1-7-medium`). Unknown id fails; `effort` warns and is ignored. Mode forced to `bypass`. Revive via `session/load` (replays into `get_transcript`; `get_result` stays clean).
   - ZCode: `provider\model` or a unique bare id. Effort maps onto thought levels (`low|high|max` is common; `off`→`low`, `medium`→`high`). Unknown or ambiguous model fails; unmappable effort warns. Mode forced to `yolo`. Revive via `session/resume`.
   - MiniMax Code: `provider/model` or `provider/model#variant`. Effort maps onto `thinkingEffort` (`off`→`default`). Unknown model fails; unmappable effort warns. Permission forced to `bypassPermissions`. Revive via `session/resume`.
3. Loop `wait_task` until terminal. A timeout is **not** failure — call it again. `silent_for_sec` is time since the last output. Silence past `stall_timeout_sec` (default 1800, per worker, 0 disables) ends `failed` / `stalled`: raise that worker's limit or resume the `session_id` with a narrower task. Size `timeout_sec` under the host MCP tool timeout:
   - Codex: `tool_timeout_sec` 600; default 180 is fine.
   - Cursor: host ~45–60 s; pass ~30 and loop.
   - Kimi Code: configure `toolTimeoutMs` 600000; otherwise ~45 s polls.
   - ZCode: configure `timeoutMs` 600000; otherwise ~15–20 s polls.
   - Grok Build: set `tool_timeout_sec` 600 (official default is 6000). If the host kills the call, ~30–45 s polls.
   - Claude Code: per-server `timeout` 600000 (ms) in `.mcp.json`. If the desktop dies around 60 s, ~45 s polls.
4. `get_result`; while `has_more` is true, call it again with `cursor=next_cursor` and concatenate the pages. Then inspect `git status` / `git diff` yourself and run the relevant build and tests. Do not trust the worker's self-report. An empty Kimi result with non-empty `warnings` is a failed turn, not a no-op.
5. If review fails, make at most one evidence-driven focused retry on the same `session_id`. After that, the coordinator or a native worker takes over.
6. Summarize the diff, leftover risk, and worker usage. `end_session` when the worker is no longer needed.

Do not drive worker GUIs or CLIs. Session resume is Bridge's job.

For retry deduplication, include a UUID `request_id` on the first call; adding it only on retry cannot deduplicate that call. Retry with identical arguments, keeping `session_id` omitted if originally omitted. Identical retries return `reused=true`; changed arguments fail. Bindings last only while this instance retains the task. Worker side effects are not exactly-once.
